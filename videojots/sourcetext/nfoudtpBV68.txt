{|6660|Welcome to the course of Natural Language Processing. Why study Natural Language Processing?|}{|16920|/n//n/ /b/Question answering/ IBM Watson won Jeopardy on Feb 16, 2011|}{|36240|/n//n/ /b/Information Extraction/ is another important task. We would like software to extract date, time and place from an email into a Calendar entry|}{|79028|/n//n/ /b/Sentiment analysis/ is another application - from a bunch of reviews about cameras on the web, we would like to extract the attributes people care about.|}{|110328|We would then like to determine how people feel about these attributes.|}{|116928|/n//n/ /b/Machine translation/ is another important application - can be fully automatic, or can be used to help human translators.|}{|176488|/n//n/ /b/State of the art/ in language technology|}{|194288|/n/ /i/Mostly solved:/ spam detection, part of speech tagging and named entity recognition|}{|215248|/n/ /i/Making good progress:/ sentiment analysis, coreference resolution, word sense disambiguation, parsing, machine translation, information extraction|}{|330091|/n//n/ Crash blossoms: a class of ambiguity problems.
